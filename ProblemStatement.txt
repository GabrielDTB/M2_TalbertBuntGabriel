Using REPLIT, you will modify the code you wrote for M1 Assignment.
Modify the creation of the array as follows:


Open the file and count how many elements are in the file.

Pass the number of elements in the file to a function that will
dynamically allocate an array of integers with the number of
elements equal to the number in the file.
The function should return a pointer to the array.

The remainder of the program should behave as outlined in the M1 Assignment,
but using pointer notation, not array notation.

If you used a Bubble Sort in the M1 assignment, please update that to
either a Selection Sort or Insertion Sort.

I will test the program with a different file of values,
so be sure it works for any number of values in a file.
